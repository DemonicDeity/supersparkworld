Super Spark World is a game I developed in Unity which mixes the combat systems of advanced fighting games with the adventurous aspects of 2D platformers and adventure games. The player controls Sparken, a god who has come to bring peace to the land with the help of a hero.

  The game is still in an early development phase, but I plan to continue work on it. A demo of the game may be found at http://willamette.edu/~lsmith/Sparken%20Test%201/Builds/index.html.
